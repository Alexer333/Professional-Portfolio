<h1> Who am I? </h1>
<h3 class="buzz"> I am Alex, presently a university student learning how to code to put together websites and other such stuff. 
  I have a huge fascination for computers and love learning about how they work! 
  I have knowledge in html, css, and javascript! I'm always striving to learn and understand code better every day, and hope 
  to be able to make many sites with different purposes. 
  
  At the present moment this is really the only site that I've made all on my own. Over time I hope to make it look better with the knowledge I gain.
